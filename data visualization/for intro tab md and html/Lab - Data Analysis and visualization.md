# Lab : Data Analysis and visualizations

### Brief

This project is for the lab I've taken this summer semester.

I finished 3 subtasks : 

- course selection(Sankey)
- time & performance(Scatter)
- popular courses(Word cloud)



### Architecture

MySQL - Django - Front end 



### Interesting

I implemented a spell checker for German courses with little knowledge about German.

The Sankey diagram is really cool and helpful for course selection, I implemented an algorithm similar to constructing a FP-tree.
